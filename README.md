## What is it ?
This project serves as a foundational structure designed to facilitate the creation of modular code, making it easier to manage and maintain across various Version Control System (VCS) repositories. All modules are organized within the modules directory, effectively separating them from the general configurations applied to the entire application scope. Furthermore, the flexibility of the system allows for the independent installation of Composer packages suffixed with -module from private or public registries directly into the modules directory, ensuring a clear delineation of business logic
